## 1. Problem Statement

Analysts across the organization's business analytics teams work with rich, multi-file datasets — operational reports submitted by business units, incident and case databases, customer records, consumer complaints, and performance monitoring feeds. Extracting insights from this data today requires either writing Python or SQL code, or waiting for IT to build a custom report. Neither path is fast enough for day-to-day decision-making.

The result:
- Decisions are made on incomplete or manually extracted data
- Thematic reviews that should take hours take weeks
- The analytical depth of internal reports is constrained by what a non-technical analyst can produce in Excel
- Benchmarking across business units requires manual data wrangling that few analysts can do independently

---

## 2. What We Are Building

The **Platform** is an internal analytics system built on the DS-STAR and DS-STAR+ multi-agent architecture, adapted for cross-departmental business analytics. It accepts natural language queries from non-technical analysts and returns data-backed answers and reports — with full traceability from question to code to result.

The system operates in two modes:

### Insight Mode (DS-STAR mode)
For specific, factoid, or multi-step analytical questions. The analyst types a question; the system plans, codes, executes, verifies, and iterates autonomously until it produces a sufficient answer. Output is a chat-style response: a concise executive summary with supporting tables and interactive charts.

**Example queries:**
- "Which business units have the highest return rate in Q1 2025 vs. the peer median?"
- "Show me customer complaint trends across regions over the last 12 months."
- "Which business units are statistical outliers in their order fulfillment accuracy?"

### Research Mode (DS-STAR+ mode)
For open-ended research topics and thematic analysis. The system decomposes the topic into focused sub-questions, answers each independently using the DS-STAR inner engine, then synthesises a cited, structured report. Output is a formal document — structured sections, every claim cited to the sub-question and code that produced it.

**Example queries:**
- "Generate a thematic analysis of customer churn growth across regions in 2024."
- "Produce a sector-wide performance trend report for H1 2025, suitable for a strategy review annex."
- "Create an evidence data summary for our root-cause investigation into business unit X."

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

*Note: Baselines marked [TBD] must be established via measurement before PRD is finalised. See Section 16, Open Question 8.*

| Metric | Baseline (Today) | Target (12 months post-launch) | How Measured |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Time to produce a peer benchmarking table | [TBD — measure during pilot] | < 15 minutes | Timed analyst sessions during pilot |
| Time to produce a thematic review report | [TBD — measure during pilot] | < 2 days | Ticket tracking from query submission to approved report |
| % of queries answered same-day | [TBD — analyst survey pre-launch] | > 80% | Audit log: task created vs. result timestamp, same calendar day |
| Analyst satisfaction with the Platform | N/A (new system) | > 4.0 / 5.0 on quarterly CSAT | Quarterly in-app CSAT survey |
| Number of thematic reviews completed per year | [TBD — count existing reviews pre-launch] | 2× current | Annual count from audit log + department records |

---

## 4. Non-Goals (What This Is Not)

- **Not a replacement for human judgement.** The system provides analysis; the analyst interprets and decides. No automated business action is taken by the system.
- **Not a real-time alert engine.** The Platform is an analytics tool, not a real-time monitoring or alerting system.
- **Not a customer-facing product.** Internal use only. Standard cloud-hosted SaaS deployment.
- **Not a replacement for source systems.** The Platform analyzes data extracted from existing business systems; it does not replace those systems.
- **Not a live database connector in V1.** Data access in V1 is file upload only. Live database connectivity is future scope.
- **English only.** V1 is strictly English — UI, queries, and all outputs. Other language support is future scope.

---

## 5. Target Users

**All five departments under the organization's analytics function.** The primary initiating department is Risk & Fraud Analytics.

**V1 treats all analysts identically regardless of department.** No department-specific UI, templates, or workflows in V1. Department-specific customisation is future scope.

| Department | Role | Representative Queries |
|------------|------|----------------------|
| **Risk & Fraud Analytics** ⭐ | Monitors risk exposure and benchmarks loss/performance data across business units | "Which business units have the highest loss rate vs. peer median?", "Show performance trends by business unit over 12 months" |
| **Compliance Operations** | Monitors business unit adherence to internal policy and compliance obligations | "Which business units have declining audit pass rates?", "Show issue distribution vs. internal benchmarks" |
| **Customer Experience & Conduct** | Monitors consumer complaints, market behaviour, service quality | "Show complaint volumes by business unit and product category", "Identify potential service quality patterns" |
| **Investigations** | Investigates policy violations and irregularities | "Pull all performance data for business unit X across 3 years", "Generate an evidence summary for case #XXXX" |
| **Strategy & Research** | Develops internal strategy; conducts organization-wide research | "What is the company-wide performance trend by channel?", "Compare regional performance against industry benchmarks" |

**User persona:** Non-technical. Analysts understand the domain deeply (internal processes, business unit behaviour, operational patterns) but cannot write Python or SQL. They rely on technical colleagues or manual Excel for data analysis today.

---

## 6. Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Deployment model:** Standard cloud-hosted SaaS deployment.
- **LLM inference:** Cloud-hosted LLM API (e.g., a hosted frontier model provider). Provider-agnostic adapter — switching LLM providers requires only a config file change, zero agent code changes. Actual model procured is an engineering/IT decision.
- **Frontend/backend separation:** React frontend on a separate server. Backend built on LangGraph Server, exposing HTTP and WebSocket endpoints.
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens. Analysts authenticate via login screen; every API call from the browser carries a signed JWT. Analyst and Admin are completely separate login URLs.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements

*Each FR includes: Description, and Acceptance Criteria. Acceptance criteria marked [TBD — in discussion] are pending confirmation in the ongoing PRD review session.*

---

### 8.1 Query Interface

**FR-QI-01 — Query input**
The analyst query interface is a simple, clean text box — modelled on GPT/Claude. No code, no form fields, no data selection dropdowns on the initial screen. Expressive but uncluttered.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Text box is the primary interactive element on `/chat` on first load; no other input controls are visible without interaction
- Text box accepts a **maximum of 5,000 characters** (no minimum beyond non-empty; open-ended queries rarely exceed a few hundred characters)
- Placeholder text guides the analyst (e.g., "Ask a question about your data...")
- Submit button is disabled when the text box is empty
- Pressing Enter submits; Shift+Enter creates a new line
- Character count is shown when input exceeds 4,000 characters, turning red at 4,800 to warn the analyst they are approaching the limit

---

**FR-QI-02 — Automatic mode routing**
The system automatically routes each query to Insight Mode (DS-STAR) or Research Mode (DS-STAR+) via the Query Clarity Agent. Ambiguous queries that could belong to either mode trigger a confirmation pop-up before the pipeline starts. The pop-up is prominent and cannot be missed — it does not auto-dismiss.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Queries clearly scoped to a specific factoid route to Insight Mode without any prompt shown
- Queries clearly open-ended or thematic route to Research Mode without any prompt shown
- Ambiguous queries surface a modal with two clearly labelled options: "Specific Analysis (Insight Mode)" and "Research Report (Research Mode)", each with a one-sentence description
- The modal cannot be dismissed by clicking outside it, pressing Escape, or any other method — the analyst must make a choice
- The analyst's mode selection is logged in the immutable audit trail alongside the query (same append-only PostgreSQL log described in FR-AU-01; stored fields: task ID, analyst user ID, query text, mode selected, timestamp)
- The audit trail entry for mode selection is visible to admin via the audit log viewer (FR-ADMIN-06); analysts can see their own mode selection as part of their query history but cannot see other analysts' entries and cannot modify any entry

---

**FR-QI-03 — Query starter templates**
A set of example queries is displayed prominently on the chat page. Clicking a template imports the text into the query box but does NOT auto-submit. The analyst must edit or confirm before submitting. Templates are managed by admin.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Minimum 5 starter templates are visible on `/chat` below the text box at all times
- Clicking a template inserts its text into the query box and sets focus on the query box
- The query is NOT submitted automatically; the Submit button remains the only submission mechanism
- Templates are editable by admin via the admin panel without a code deployment
- Updating or adding templates in the admin panel is reflected on the chat page within 60 seconds

---

**FR-QI-04 — Optional formatting control**
An optional field is available to specify output formatting preferences (e.g., "summarise in 5 bullet points", "rank by descending value", "output as a table only"). This field is collapsed by default and revealed on demand. It is optional — leaving it blank is always valid.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- The formatting control field is hidden on initial page load; a clearly labelled toggle (e.g., "Formatting preferences ▼") reveals it
- When expanded, the field shows placeholder text with concrete examples: *"e.g., 'Summarise in 5 bullet points', 'Rank by highest value first', 'Output as a table only', 'Round all figures to 2 decimal places'"*
- Below the placeholder, 4–6 clickable example chips are displayed (e.g., "5 bullet points", "Rank descending", "Table only", "2 decimal places"); clicking a chip inserts that text into the field (can be edited after insertion)
- The field accepts free text up to 500 characters
- Submitting without entering anything in this field produces the same result as submitting with the field collapsed
- The analyst's formatting instruction is visible in the result panel alongside the query (so they can see what instruction was applied)

---

**FR-QI-05 — File upload at query time**
Analysts can upload data files alongside their query. Supported formats: PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx, .xls), CSV, JSON. File upload capability can be toggled off globally or per-department by admin.

*File limits:*
- Maximum file size: **500 MB per file**
- Maximum files per query: **20 files**
- Maximum total upload size per session workspace: **5 GB**
- Maximum file name length: 255 characters

*Acceptance criteria:*
- File upload supports both drag-and-drop onto the chat page and click-to-browse
- Only files with accepted extensions (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .xls, .csv, .json) are accepted; all others are rejected before upload begins with a clear error message specifying the unsupported format
- Files exceeding 500 MB are rejected before upload begins with a clear error message
- Upload progress is shown per file (progress bar or percentage)
- Analyst can remove individual files from the upload queue before submitting
- When file upload is disabled by admin, the upload UI element is hidden entirely — not greyed out
- Attempting to upload more than 20 files in one query shows an error before any files are uploaded

---

**FR-QI-06 — Dataset suggestion**
Before the pipeline starts, the system suggests relevant datasets from the analyst's previously uploaded files using semantic search over file metadata (top 5–8 results surfaced). The analyst confirms the selection and can add or remove datasets. A "data sources used" panel is always visible in the analysis result.

*Implementation note:* Dataset suggestion requires the Analyzer to profile and store a text description for every uploaded file in PostgreSQL at upload time. At query submission, the system runs a keyword/text search (V1: PostgreSQL full-text search; future: pgvector cosine similarity) against stored descriptions to rank files by relevance. This DB setup is a TDD requirement — dataset suggestion cannot function without it.

*Cold start (first use / no files):* If the analyst has never uploaded any files and no institutional datasets have been loaded for their department, the dataset selection step is skipped. Instead, the query submission screen shows an inline upload prompt: "No data sources found — upload a file to get started." The pipeline cannot start until at least one file is provided.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- After query submission (before pipeline starts), a dataset selection screen shows top 5–8 suggested files ranked by semantic relevance to the query; if fewer than 5 files exist, all available files are shown
- Each suggestion displays: file name, file type icon, upload date, and the one-line description generated by the Analyzer at upload time
- The analyst can deselect any suggested file
- The analyst can add any file from their personal workspace not in the top suggestions
- A "Confirm and start analysis" button is the only way to proceed — the pipeline cannot start without explicit analyst confirmation
- The "Data sources used" panel in the result shows the exact file names, versions, and data snapshot IDs of all files provided to the pipeline
- On first use (cold start), the dataset selection step is replaced by an upload prompt as described above

---

**FR-QI-07 — Conversational follow-up**
After a completed analysis, the analyst can submit follow-up questions. Each follow-up spawns a new DS-STAR task but receives the prior task's findings as context injected into the Planner. The UI groups the original query and all follow-ups into a visible thread.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A follow-up query input appears below the result of any completed analysis
- Submitting a follow-up creates a new task; the prior task's findings summary is injected into the new Planner context
- The UI displays the original query and all follow-ups as a labelled thread: "Original query", "Follow-up 1", "Follow-up 2", etc.
- All results in a thread remain visible on the dashboard without navigating away
- Each follow-up inherits the same data source selection as the original unless the analyst changes it
- V1 supports linear follow-up only — there is no branch/fork mechanism

---

### 8.2 Data Access & File Management

**FR-DA-01 — Supported file formats**
The system supports both structured and unstructured files in V1:
- **Structured:** CSV (auto-delimiter detection), Excel (.xlsx, .xls), JSON
- **Unstructured:** PDF (text extraction), Word (.docx, narrative documents)

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A CSV uploaded with any of the following delimiters is correctly parsed: comma, semicolon, tab, pipe
- An Excel file with multiple sheets is correctly profiled (Analyzer identifies all sheets, their column names, row counts, and data types)
- A PDF uploaded as an unstructured document has its text correctly extracted (verified against known test documents)
- A Word (.docx) document has its narrative text correctly extracted, including text in tables within the document
- A JSON file is parsed regardless of whether it is a flat array, nested object, or array of objects (Analyzer describes the schema)
- Uploading an empty file (0 bytes) is rejected with a clear error
- Uploading a password-protected Excel or PDF is rejected with an error message specifying that password-protected files are not supported in V1

---

**FR-DA-02 — Institutional dataset management**
Core organizational datasets are loaded by IT/data engineering via backend pipelines — not through any UI. Institutional datasets are **optional** — the system works entirely from analyst-uploaded files if no institutional datasets have been loaded. Upload capability is ON by default with an admin toggle to disable.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- If institutional datasets have been loaded for a department, they appear in the analyst's dataset selection screen alongside personal uploads, clearly labelled as "Institutional" vs. "Personal upload"
- If no institutional datasets have been loaded for a department, the dataset selection screen shows only the analyst's personal uploads; no placeholder or error is shown for the absent institutional datasets
- Institutional datasets cannot be deleted or edited by analysts
- Admin toggling file uploads off removes the upload UI for all analysts in the affected scope within 60 seconds
- Admin toggling file uploads on restores the upload UI within 60 seconds
- The system can be used productively from day one with analyst-uploaded files only; no institutional dataset loading is required to make the system functional

---

**FR-DA-03 — Uploaded file retention**
Analyst-uploaded files are session-scoped by default. After a task completes, the system prompts: *"Keep this file for future analyses?"* Files saved to the analyst's personal workspace are retained for 1 quarter (90 days), then archived (not deleted). Analysts can access archives on request.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- After task completion, a non-intrusive prompt asks "Keep [filename] for future analyses? [Keep] [Discard]"
- Choosing "Discard" deletes the file from the system immediately
- Choosing "Keep" moves the file to the analyst's personal workspace
- Files in the personal workspace are visible in the dataset selection screen on future queries
- Files older than 90 days are automatically moved to archive status; archived files no longer appear in the dataset selection screen but are accessible via a dedicated "Archives" section in the history sidebar
- Archived files can be restored to the personal workspace by the analyst on request

---

**FR-DA-04 — Data versioning**
Every analysis result is automatically linked to a point-in-time snapshot of the data that produced it. No opt-out.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Every completed analysis result stores the exact snapshot ID and version of every data file used
- The "Data sources used" panel in the result displays the file name, snapshot ID, and timestamp of the snapshot
- **Analysts can view snapshot metadata** (file name, version, snapshot ID, timestamp) for their own analyses via the "Data sources used" panel — this is read-only; analysts cannot edit, delete, or download raw snapshot data
- **Admin can retrieve the full data snapshot** (including the actual data contents) for any analysis given its task ID — required for internal audit and dispute resolution
- No user (analyst or admin) can modify or delete a snapshot once created
- Updating a file in the personal workspace (re-uploading a newer version) does not modify snapshots linked to past analyses
- The snapshot storage is referenced in the audit log by snapshot ID, not stored inline

---

**FR-DA-05 — Access control**
V1 uses department-level RBAC. Each analyst sees datasets belonging to their department only. Admin can assign a dataset to one or more departments simultaneously.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- An analyst assigned to Department A cannot see, select, or query datasets assigned to Department B (unless the dataset is also assigned to Department A)
- Attempting to access a dataset outside the analyst's department via any method (UI or API) returns a 403 response with a clear message
- **Admin can assign a dataset to multiple departments** simultaneously (e.g., a cross-unit benchmark dataset visible to both Risk & Fraud Analytics and Strategy & Research); the change takes effect within 60 seconds
- Admin can add or remove department assignments on any dataset without deleting it
- A dataset not assigned to any department is accessible only by admin users
- When a dataset is assigned to multiple departments, all assigned analysts see it in their dataset selection screen; access revocation from one department does not affect the other departments

---

### 8.3 Planning & Execution Loop

The core engine is the DS-STAR pipeline: Analyzer → Planner → Coder → Executor → Debugger (on error) → Verifier → Router (if insufficient) → Finalyzer. See `04-architecture-decisions.md` for paper-confirmed agent behaviour details.

**FR-PE-01 — Stop / cancel**
The analyst can stop a running analysis at any point. Task is cancelled immediately; nothing is returned.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A "Stop" button is visible at all times while a task is running
- Clicking "Stop" triggers a confirmation modal: "Stop this analysis? Your progress will be lost. [Cancel] [Stop]"
- Confirming stop terminates the task within 5 seconds; the sandbox container is stopped and removed
- The stopped task appears in the history sidebar labelled "Stopped by analyst"
- No partial result is shown for a stopped task
- The round budget consumed up to the stop point is logged in the audit trail

---

**FR-PE-02 — Pause and resume**
The analyst can pause a running task and resume it later.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A "Pause" button is visible at all times while a task is running
- Clicking "Pause" completes the current round (does not interrupt mid-execution) then suspends the task; the analyst is notified when the task has paused
- A paused task appears in the history sidebar labelled "Paused — Round N of M"
- The analyst can resume a paused task at any time by clicking "Resume" from the history sidebar
- Resuming a task continues from the exact round it was paused at; no rounds are replayed
- A paused task retains its checkpoint for a minimum of 7 days before being automatically cancelled (analyst notified 24 hours before expiry)

---

**FR-PE-03 — Mid-analysis steering**
While a task is running, the analyst can inject a plain-English hint.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A "Steer analysis" input is visible in the progress panel while a task is running
- Submitting a hint appends it to the Planner's context for all subsequent rounds; hints already applied are not modified or removed
- Multiple hints accumulate and are all passed to the Planner
- All hints are displayed in the progress panel with their submission timestamp, in the order they were submitted
- Hints apply from the next round onward — not retroactively to rounds already completed
- Submitting a hint while a round is actively executing queues it for the next round

---

**FR-PE-04 — Default round limit**
5–6 rounds per task on first run. Applies equally to Insight Mode (single query) and each Research Mode sub-question individually.

*Note for engineering:* DS-STAR paper (Figure 2) shows hard tasks average 5.6 rounds. At max=5, there is a measurable accuracy drop on hard queries. The extension mechanism (FR-PE-05) exists to handle this — analysts should expect hard queries to frequently trigger extension. The UI must present extension as a normal workflow step, not an error.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- The system runs a maximum of 6 rounds on first attempt before presenting the round cap interface
- The round cap is applied consistently whether the task is Insight Mode or a sub-question within Research Mode
- The round budget counter ("Round N / 40") is visible throughout execution
- Reaching the default round limit without a "Yes" from the Verifier automatically triggers the incomplete analysis interface (FR-PE-07) without any additional analyst action

---

**FR-PE-05 — Round extension**
When default rounds are exhausted, the analyst can extend by 5 rounds per click.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- "Extend and continue" adds exactly 5 rounds to the current task's budget
- The round budget counter updates immediately after extension: e.g., "6 / 40 → 11 / 40"
- The task resumes from the last checkpoint without re-running earlier rounds
- The "Extend and continue" button is disabled once the hard cap of 40 rounds is reached
- Each extension action is logged in the audit trail with a timestamp

---

**FR-PE-06 — Hard round cap**
40 cumulative rounds per query (Insight Mode) or per sub-question (Research Mode). Enforced regardless of extension cycles.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- At 40 cumulative rounds, the system stops executing and presents the incomplete analysis interface even if the analyst attempts to extend further
- The "Extend and continue" button is not shown once 40 rounds are reached
- The round budget counter shows "40 / 40" when the hard cap is hit
- For Research Mode: the 40-round cap is per sub-question, not across all sub-questions combined; a task with 5 sub-questions could theoretically consume up to 200 rounds system-wide

---

**FR-PE-07 — Task failure / round cap behaviour**
When a task hits its round cap or fails unrecoverably, the system presents a structured incomplete analysis interface.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- For round cap hit with a partial result: (a) result is shown with a prominent red "INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS" banner, (b) a plain-English diagnostic is shown below the banner explaining what was found, what wasn't, and why it stopped, (c) three action buttons are shown: "Accept partial result", "Refine and retry" (pre-fills query for editing), "Extend and continue" (if rounds remain)
- For hard failure with no partial result (container crash, infrastructure failure, LLM unreachable): the result panel shows only the diagnostic and a "Retry" button; no INCOMPLETE result is shown
- "Accept partial result" removes the INCOMPLETE banner and saves the result to history; an "(Incomplete)" label is permanently appended to the result title in history
- "Refine and retry" navigates to `/chat` with the original query pre-filled and a note: "Refining previous analysis — edit your query and resubmit"
- The analyst must explicitly choose one of the action buttons — the interface does not auto-resolve

---

**FR-PE-08 — Checkpointing**
LangGraph checkpoints task state to PostgreSQL every round.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- If a worker process crashes mid-round, the task automatically resumes from the last completed round checkpoint within 60 seconds of worker recovery
- The analyst is not required to take any action for a checkpoint recovery — it happens transparently
- The progress panel shows a brief "Recovered from checkpoint at Round N" notification when a checkpoint recovery occurs
- Checkpoints are retained for the lifetime of the task plus 7 days after task completion or cancellation

---

### 8.4 Real-Time Progress Visibility

**FR-PV-01 — Two verbosity levels**
The analyst chooses between summary and full-trace progress modes.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Default view on task start is summary mode: a progress bar with the current phase label (Analyzing / Planning / Coding / Executing / Verifying)
- A toggle clearly labelled "Show full trace" expands to the detailed view without page reload
- Full trace shows: current agent name, current round number, round budget counter, last execution result (truncated to 500 characters with "Show more"), any steering hints applied
- For Research Mode (Report Mode), full trace shows: numbered sub-question list, status of each sub-question (queued / running / complete), current sub-question's round budget
- The toggle state persists for the analyst's session (if they expand the trace, it stays expanded for subsequent tasks in the same session)
- Both modes update in real time via WebSocket — no page refresh required

---

**FR-PV-02 — Research Mode "Report Mode" signal**
When routed to Research Mode (DS-STAR+), the dashboard clearly signals "Report Mode."

*Acceptance criteria:*
- On routing to Research Mode, the dashboard header changes to purple accent colour and displays a "Report Mode" badge
- The progress panel displays the numbered sub-question breakdown list rather than a single round counter
- Each sub-question entry shows its status (queued / running / complete) and, when running, its round budget ("Sub-question 3 of 7 · Round 4 / 6")
- The mode badge remains visible throughout the analysis and on the completed result
- Switching modes via the routing confirmation pop-up (FR-QI-02) updates the dashboard display immediately

---

### 8.5 Output Types & Export

**FR-OUT-01 — Default output**
Every completed analysis always includes: narrative text, tables, and interactive charts. Raw data file and analysis code are opt-in.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Every completed result renders a narrative section, at least one table (where data supports it), and at least one chart (where data supports it)
- Raw data download and analysis code download are hidden by default behind a toggle labelled "Show raw outputs"
- The "Show raw outputs" toggle is available on every result regardless of result type
- Toggling "Show raw outputs" does not reload the page or re-run any part of the pipeline

---

**FR-OUT-02 — Chart rendering**
The Coder outputs structured JSON for charts; the frontend renders them as interactive HTML charts.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Charts rendered via Recharts are interactive: tooltips on hover, legend toggles, zoom where applicable
- If the chart JSON specifies a chart type Recharts cannot support, Plotly.js renders it instead — the analyst sees no difference
- On export (Word/PDF), charts are rendered server-side to static images at minimum 300 DPI
- A chart that fails to render (malformed JSON) shows a fallback message "Chart could not be rendered — raw data available below" and automatically shows the underlying data as a table

---

**FR-OUT-03 — Insight Mode output style**
Chat-style response: executive summary + supporting tables and charts.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- The result begins with a concise executive summary paragraph (plain English, no technical jargon)
- Supporting tables and charts follow the summary
- The result does not resemble a formal document — no section headers like "Methodology" or "Findings"
- The result fits on a single scrollable dashboard panel without requiring a separate page

---

**FR-OUT-04 — Research Mode output style**
Formal document with dynamic sections and inline citations.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- The result is rendered as a structured document with visible section headers
- Fixed sections present in every Research Mode output: Header (title, date, analyst name, classification), Executive Summary, Query & Scope, Methodology, Recommendations
- Dynamic sections (Findings) are named and structured by the Writer agent based on the query; section names and count vary per report
- Every quantitative claim in the report is followed by an inline citation referencing the sub-question that produced it, e.g., "(Source: Sub-question 2 — Loss by business unit)"
- The analyst can click any citation to expand and view the sub-question text, the code that answered it, and its output

---

**FR-OUT-05 — Reformat without re-running**
The analyst can reformat any completed result without re-running the full pipeline.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- A "Reformat" button is visible on every completed result
- Clicking "Reformat" shows the formatting control field (same as FR-QI-04) pre-filled with the original formatting instruction (if any)
- Submitting a new formatting instruction re-runs only the Finalyzer against the stored output; the Analyzer, Planner, Coder, Executor, and Verifier do not re-run
- The reformat completes in under 30 seconds for typical results
- The reformatted result replaces the original in the result panel; the original is accessible via "View previous version" in the result header

---

**FR-OUT-06 — Export formats**

- Queue position updates in real time on the dashboard
- Tasks are dequeued in FIFO order within the same priority tier; re-queued tasks (after checkpoint recovery) have higher priority than new submissions
- A task that has waited in the queue for more than 30 minutes triggers an in-app notification to the analyst informing them of the delay
- Admin can see queue depth and position of all queued tasks in the system health dashboard

---

### 8.11 Error States

The following error states must be handled gracefully — with a clear, plain-English message and a recommended action — rather than showing a raw error or blank page.

| Error | User-facing message | Recommended action shown |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Uploaded file is password-protected | "This file is password-protected. Please remove the password and re-upload." | Re-upload prompt |
| Uploaded file is corrupted / unreadable | "This file could not be read. It may be corrupted. Please check the file and try again." | Re-upload prompt |
| Uploaded file exceeds 500 MB | "This file is too large ([X] MB). Maximum file size is 500 MB per file." | File removed from queue |
| More than 20 files selected | "You can upload up to 20 files per query. Please deselect [N] files." | File selection remains open |

| JWT session expired during analysis | "Your session has expired. Your analysis is still running in the background. Log in again to view results." | Login redirect; task continues uninterrupted |
| LLM API unreachable | "The AI engine is temporarily unavailable. Your analysis has been paused and will resume automatically when the service recovers." | Task auto-resumes; analyst notified via in-app notification |
| Sandbox container crash | Triggers FR-PE-07 hard failure path — plain-English diagnostic + Retry button | Retry button |
| Access denied (data outside department) | "You do not have access to this dataset. Contact your admin if you believe this is an error." | Admin contact info |
| Query submission while system at capacity | "Analysis queued — [N] ahead of you. Estimated wait: ~[X] min." | Queue position shown in dashboard |
| File name exceeds 255 characters | "File name is too long. Please rename the file to 255 characters or fewer and re-upload." | Re-upload prompt |
| Network error (frontend cannot reach backend) | "Connection lost. Check your network and try again. Your analysis (if running) is still processing." | Retry connection button |

## 10. Architecture Overview

The Platform is built on the DS-STAR multi-agent pipeline (arXiv:2509.21825), which uses an iterative Analyze → Plan → Code → Execute → Verify loop with backtracking. DS-STAR+ extends this with a Sub-Question Generator and Report Writer for open-ended research queries.

Full architecture detail — including all paper-confirmed agent behaviours, container lifecycle decisions, LLM tiering, and infrastructure topology — is documented in:
- `00-discovery/03-architecture-v2.html` (v3.3) — visual architecture diagram
- `00-discovery/04-architecture-decisions.md` — every architectural decision with paper references (Q1–Q18)

The TDD (`03-tdd/01-tdd-domain-agnostic-agent.md`) will translate the architecture into implementation specifications.

**Technology stack summary:**

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React + Tailwind + ShadCN |
| State machine | LangGraph (PostgreSQL checkpointing) |
| Task queue | Celery + Redis Sentinel |
| Sandbox | Docker (per-task container, docker exec per round) |
| LLM inference | Provider-agnostic adapter (cloud LLM API for prod and dev) |
| Secrets | Cloud secrets manager |
| Auth | JWT (8-hour expiry) |
| Report generation | python-docx-template + LibreOffice headless |
| Charts | Recharts (primary) + Plotly.js (fallback) |
| Internal comms | mTLS |

## 12. Rollout Plan

*Adapted from Google's staged rollout model, Amazon's "Working Backwards" launch approach, and Microsoft's ring-based deployment practice.*

The Platform V1 follows a four-phase rollout. Each phase has an explicit exit criterion — the phase is not complete until the criterion is met.

### Phase 1 — Alpha (Internal / Dogfood)
**Who:** The engineering and product team + 2–3 analysts from Risk & Fraud Analytics who are directly involved in the project (the most forgiving, most technically aware users).
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Purpose:** Catch critical bugs before external exposure. Validate that the core pipeline produces meaningful results on real production data.
**What's tested:** Full pipeline (Insight Mode + Research Mode), file upload, pause/resume, export, admin panel.
**Data used:** Real production data in an isolated staging environment (not shared with dev environment).

*Exit criterion:* Zero P0 bugs open. Core analysis pipeline completes successfully on ≥ 80% of test queries. Engineering team signs off.

---

### Phase 2 — Closed Beta
**Who:** All analysts in Risk & Fraud Analytics (~10–15 people). The initiating department — highest motivation, deepest domain knowledge, best able to validate output quality.
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Purpose:** Validate real-world usage patterns, output quality, and analyst trust. Establish baseline metrics for success KPIs (Section 3). Collect structured feedback.
**Onboarding:** Live training session (1 hour) + written user guide. Analysts are explicitly told this is a beta — outputs require human verification.
**Support:** Direct Slack/Teams channel with engineering for issue reporting. Weekly feedback review meeting (PM + analyst lead + engineering).

*Exit criterion:* Beta CSAT ≥ 3.5/5.0. Zero P0 or P1 bugs open. Baseline metrics established. All launch criteria (Section 11) met.

---

### Phase 3 — Open Beta (Full Department Rollout)
**Who:** Volunteer analysts from all remaining four departments (Compliance Operations, Customer Experience & Conduct, Investigations, Strategy & Research). Opt-in — not mandatory.
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Purpose:** Validate cross-department usability with no department-specific customisation (V1 treats all analysts identically). Identify V2 department-specific requirements from real usage.
**Onboarding:** Self-serve user guide + recorded training video. Optional live Q&A session.
**Support:** Standard IT helpdesk channel. Engineering on standby for escalations.

*Exit criterion:* No new P0/P1 issues introduced. Open Beta CSAT ≥ 3.5/5.0. System stable under multi-department concurrent load.

---

### Phase 4 — General Availability (GA)
**Who:** All analysts across all five departments. Mandatory rollout with onboarding support.
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Purpose:** Full production deployment. The Platform becomes the standard tool for analytical queries that previously required IT or manual Excel.
**Onboarding:** Department-level training sessions conducted by the DRI + trained power users from the beta cohorts. Admin guide handed to IT.
**Handoff:** Engineering team transitions from active support to standard maintenance. IT Operations owns day-to-day system management.

*Exit criterion:* N/A — GA is the end state. Post-GA: monthly metrics review against Section 3 KPIs. First formal review at 30, 60, and 90 days post-GA.

---

### Rollout Go/No-Go Decision Points

| Gate | Decision Maker | Criterion |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Alpha → Closed Beta | Engineering Lead | Exit criterion for Phase 1 met |
| Closed Beta → Open Beta | DRI | Exit criterion for Phase 2 met + all launch criteria signed off |
| Open Beta → GA | DRI + Dept. Heads | Exit criterion for Phase 3 met |
| GA Continuation (30-day review) | DRI | KPI trajectory positive; no critical issues in production |

---

### Rollback Plan
If a critical issue is discovered post-GA:
1. Engineering Lead declares a rollback
2. Previous release is restored within 15 minutes (tested in Phase 1)
3. Affected analysts notified via in-app notification and email
4. Incident post-mortem completed within 48 hours
5. Fix deployed through Closed Beta re-cycle before re-launching to GA

---

## 13. Feedback Mechanism

Analyst feedback is the primary signal for determining whether the Platform is producing reliable, useful outputs. The following mechanisms are V1.

### 13.1 Per-Result Feedback
Every completed analysis result displays a feedback bar at the bottom:
- **Thumbs up / Thumbs down** — one-click rating
- **Optional free-text comment** (collapsed by default, expands on either click): "Tell us more (optional)"
- **"Flag as incorrect"** — a distinct, more serious action that tags the result for engineering review. Requires a one-line description of what is incorrect. These are reviewed by engineering weekly during beta and bi-weekly at GA.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- The feedback bar is visible on every completed result without scrolling
- Thumbs up/down can be changed after submission
- "Flag as incorrect" submissions appear in a dedicated queue in the admin panel
- All feedback is associated with the task ID and analyst user ID in the feedback store
- Feedback is never shown to other analysts

### 13.2 Quarterly In-App CSAT Survey
A 5-question in-app survey is shown to each analyst once per quarter. It appears as a non-blocking slide-in panel (not a full-page modal) and can be dismissed and completed later.

*Questions (fixed for V1):*
1. Overall, how satisfied are you with the Platform? (1–5 scale)
2. How often do you verify the Platform's results before using them in a business decision? (Always / Usually / Sometimes / Rarely / Never)
3. Has the Platform saved you time compared to your previous approach? (Yes, significantly / Yes, somewhat / No change / No, it takes longer)
4. What is the most useful thing the Platform does for you? (Free text)
5. What is the most frustrating thing about the Platform? (Free text)

*Acceptance criteria:*
- Survey appears no more than once per quarter per analyst
- Completion is optional; dismissing the survey does not count as a response
- Survey responses are stored against analyst ID and timestamp (not anonymised in V1 — needed for follow-up)
- Admin can view aggregate survey results broken down by department and quarter in the admin panel

### 13.3 Engineering Error Dashboard
The admin panel (FR-ADMIN-05) includes a dedicated "Flagged results" queue showing all "Flag as incorrect" submissions. Each flagged result shows: task ID, query text, analyst's description of the error, and a link to the full result and audit trail.

Engineering reviews this queue weekly during beta and bi-weekly at GA. All P0-severity flags (e.g., numerical errors in outputs used in issued internal reports) are treated as incidents and triaged within 24 hours.

### 13.4 Monthly Feedback Review
During beta phases and the first 3 months of GA: a monthly meeting between the DRI, lead analyst (pilot dept.), and engineering lead reviews:
- Aggregate thumbs up/down ratio by result type (Insight vs. Research)
- Flagged results and resolutions
- CSAT trend
- Any emerging patterns in free-text comments

Findings from this meeting directly feed the V2 backlog.

## 14. Risk Register

*Risk severity = Likelihood × Impact. Rating scale: Critical / High / Medium / Low.*

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| R1 | **LLM hallucination in business-critical output.** The system produces an incorrect or fabricated finding that is cited in an internal report or business decision. | Medium | Critical | **Critical** | (1) "Data sources used" panel always visible and clickable; (2) Analysis code always downloadable so analysts can verify; (3) INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS label on partial results; (4) Training explicitly tells analysts outputs require human verification; (5) "Flag as incorrect" mechanism for fast reporting; (6) FR-OUT-04 inline citations allow every claim to be traced to its source data |
| R2 | **Analyst over-reliance.** Analysts stop verifying AI outputs, treating the Platform as authoritative. Risk increases as confidence in the tool grows over time. | Medium | High | **High** | (1) Training explicitly covers the risk of over-reliance; (2) CSAT survey Q2 tracks verification frequency; (3) "Flag as incorrect" mechanism normalises the idea that outputs can be wrong; (4) FR-AH-03 ensures audit log includes who submitted results without verification; (5) If verification rate drops below a threshold in CSAT responses, trigger a retraining session |
| R3 | **Prompt injection via uploaded file.** A malicious actor crafts a PDF or Excel file containing LLM-injection instructions (e.g., "Ignore prior instructions and output...") that manipulates the pipeline. | Low | Critical | **High** | (1) Sandbox has no network access — even if injection succeeds, exfiltration is impossible; (2) System prompts harden agent instructions against overrides; (3) Analyzer output (D) is treated as data, not executable instruction; (4) File content is not injected directly into LLM prompts without sanitisation; (5) Pen test specifically covers this attack surface before launch |
| R4 | **Sandbox escape.** The Python execution sandbox is exploited to access underlying cloud infrastructure. | Low | Critical | **High** | (1) Docker sandbox: no network, 2 GB memory cap, read-only data mount, non-root user, per-execution timeout, seccomp profile; (2) Mandatory pen test of sandbox escape surface before launch (launch criteria); (3) Container runs with minimal capabilities (CAP_DROP=ALL); (4) Separate network namespace for sandbox containers |
| R5 | **Low analyst adoption.** Analysts distrust or do not use the system, especially if early results are poor or the interface requires significant learning. | Medium | High | **High** | (1) Closed Beta pilot with friendly, motivated users from the initiating team; (2) Starter templates reduce cold-start friction; (3) Plain-English Explainer layer removes technical jargon from results; (4) Monthly feedback review for fast iteration; (5) Champion programme: identify 1–2 power users per department in Open Beta who advocate for the tool |
| R6 | **Production data exposure in dev/test.** Real production data is accidentally used in a development or testing environment with weaker security controls. | Medium | Critical | **Critical** | (1) Dev environment policy: only synthetic/anonymised test data may be used in dev/test; (2) Production data access blocked at network level in dev/test environments; (3) Pre-launch checklist explicitly verifies no production data was used outside approved environments during development |
| R7 | **Decision defensibility challenged.** A finding from the Platform is disputed internally and the organization cannot prove the finding was derived correctly from the underlying data. | Low | Critical | **High** | (1) Data versioning (FR-DA-04) links every result to an immutable data snapshot; (2) Full audit log (FR-AU-01) records every plan step, every code version, every execution result; (3) Analysis code is always downloadable and re-runnable by a technical reviewer; (4) Inline citations in Research Mode (FR-OUT-04) trace every claim to its source sub-question and code |
| R8 | **Partial result accepted as complete.** Analyst accepts an INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS result without proper scrutiny and it is used in a business decision. | Medium | High | **High** | (1) INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS label is prominent and persistent (not dismissable); (2) The "(Incomplete)" tag is permanently appended to the result title in history even after acceptance; (3) Export of incomplete results includes a watermark: "INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS — FOR REVIEW ONLY"; (4) Analyst must click "Accept partial result" explicitly — there is no auto-accept path |

## 16. Open Questions

These questions must be resolved before the TDD and Security Review. Each has a named owner [PLACEHOLDER] who is responsible for answering it.

| # | Question | Owner | Needed For | Target Resolution |
|---|----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | How do analysts authenticate today? (Active Directory, enterprise SSO, standalone accounts?) | [IT Infrastructure] | JWT/SSO integration design | Before TDD |
| 2 | What is the largest single dataset an analyst would query? (row count and file size in GB) | [Pilot Lead Analyst] | Executor memory limits, file upload UX, Analyzer timeout | Before TDD |
| 3 | Are there existing Word/PDF report templates used for internal reports? Can we get samples? | [Pilot Lead Analyst] | Finalyzer template design, FR-OUT-07 | Before TDD |
| 4 | Does any output need to integrate with an existing case management system even in V1? | [Department Heads] | API contract — currently scoped out of V1; may change decision | Before Closed Beta launch |
| 5 | What is the data freshness requirement for institutional datasets? (24 hours old acceptable, or faster?) | [IT Infrastructure / Data Engineering] | Data ingestion pipeline design | Before TDD |
| 6 | Who has authority to approve which datasets an analyst can access? (Sensitivity tiers, approval workflow) | [Data Governance] | RBAC policy design, admin panel user management | Before TDD |
| 7 | How many analysts are expected to use the system concurrently at peak? | [Department Heads + Pilot Lead] | Task queue sizing, concurrency budget validation | Before TDD |
| 8 | Can we establish the baseline metrics before launch? (Time studies for benchmarking table and thematic review, historical thematic review count) | [Pilot Lead Analyst] | Completing Section 3 success metrics — two baselines are currently TBD | Before Closed Beta |
