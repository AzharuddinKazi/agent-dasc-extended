# Product Lifecycle Documentation

This directory tracks the full pre-code and post-code lifecycle for any new feature or product initiative in this repository. It mirrors the structured process used at large tech companies (Google, Microsoft) before a single line of production code is written.

## Branch

All lifecycle documentation lives on branch: `docs/product-lifecycle`

This branch is never merged into `main`. It exists solely as a persistent, version-controlled record of research, proposals, discussions, and decisions across sessions.

---

## How to Use This Across Sessions

Each document in this folder captures the state of thinking at a point in time. Commit messages describe what was discussed or decided. To resume work in a new chat:

1. Check out `docs/product-lifecycle`
2. Read the relevant stage document(s)
3. Continue from where the last session left off
